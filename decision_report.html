<h1>FULL RESEARCH FINDINGS</h1>
<h2>Joe Biden</h2>

<h3>Political Orientation</h3>

<p>Joe Biden is a member of the Democratic Party, which is generally considered left-leaning. His key policy proposals include controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, tackling the climate crisis, advancing racial equity, addressing economic inequities, and reforming the immigration system, among others. These are generally considered liberal policies. His voting record suggests a liberal leaning, as he is considered more liberal than 68% of the 111th Senate and more conservative than 53% of Democrats. His statements on key political issues also reflect a liberal orientation, as he emphasizes the defense of democracy, the threat of election denialism and political violence, and the importance of equality.</p>

<p>Assigned label: <strong>Liberal</strong></p>

<h3>Economic Policy</h3>

<p>Based on the researched data, Joe Biden's proposed economic policies include strategies to support the middle class, extend healthcare, raise taxes on the wealthy, and invest trillions of dollars in green energy infrastructure. His economic plan consists of several components, such as the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, and the American Families Plan. The American Rescue Plan, signed into law in March 2021, provided COVID-19 relief through measures like stimulus checks, extended unemployment benefits, and funding for vaccination programs. Biden also aims to expand the Affordable Care Act to provide health insurance coverage to more Americans. In terms of taxes, Biden plans to raise the top tax rate, tax capital gains at ordinary rates, and increase the corporate tax rate. He also has proposals to address student loan debt, including making college tuition-free for certain income levels and implementing loan forgiveness programs. Additionally, Biden's economic plan includes investments in clean energy and infrastructure projects. The Biden Economic Plan aims to grow the economy, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs for families. It also includes a focus on manufacturing, infrastructure, clean energy, and science and innovation. The plan aims to lower health care costs, protect Medicare beneficiaries from skyrocketing drug costs, and promote competition in various sectors. Additionally, Biden's economic policies aim to reduce the deficit by ensuring the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share through measures such as a billionaire minimum tax, surcharge on corporate stock buybacks, and corporate minimum tax. Some key elements of his economic policy are the American Rescue Plan Act, Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Inflation Reduction Act, lowering the Medicare age, student loan forgiveness, and tax increases on higher-income individuals and corporations.</p>

<p>The predicted impact of Joe Biden's proposed economic policies on the economy is generally positive. They aim to support the middle class, extend healthcare, raise taxes on the wealthy, and invest trillions of dollars in green energy infrastructure. Biden's economic plan includes the American Rescue Plan, the American Jobs Plan, and the American Families Plan. The American Rescue Plan provided COVID-19 relief through a $1.9 trillion package that included stimulus checks, extended unemployment benefits, and funding for vaccine rollout. In terms of taxes, Biden's plan aims to raise tax revenue by increasing the top tax rate, taxing capital gains at ordinary rates, and raising the corporate tax rate. He also plans to address student loan debt by offering free college for those making up to $125,000 and forgiving a minimum of $10,000 of student debt per person. Biden's economic plan also focuses on workers' rights, promoting "Made in America" manufacturing, and investing in infrastructure and climate change initiatives. The state of the economy is strong, with historic progress in bringing the economy back from the pandemic and creating more jobs in a two-year period than under any other president on record. The Biden administration has also focused on lowering costs for families, including cutting prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, and energy bills. The economic strategy has been fiscally responsible, with a reduction in the deficit by $1.7 trillion under President Biden. His reforms to take on Big Pharma, lower prescription drug costs, and make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share will further reduce the deficit. However, the impact of these policies on the economy will depend on various factors, including implementation, economic conditions, and the response of businesses and individuals.</p>

<p>Joe Biden's track record on economic issues is multifaceted. He has been credited with major spending packages such as the American Rescue Plan and the Inflation Reduction Act, which directed trillions of dollars towards infrastructure, workforce development, and the public health response to Covid. This has led to improvements in the labor market, with the unemployment rate decreasing and pandemic-induced job losses being restored. His economic plan, known as 'Bidenomics', focuses on growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, making public investments, empowering workers, promoting competition, and ensuring fiscal responsibility. However, challenges such as inflation, hiring difficulties for small businesses, and high household debt persist. Despite record job creation and a low unemployment rate, discontent due to inflation has affected Biden's approval rating. His administration is working to sell Americans on a range of efforts under 'Bidenomics', including manufacturing investments and high-speed internet access expansion, but most Americans have yet to fully feel the impact of these laws.</p>

<p>Assigned label: <strong>Neutral</strong></p>

<h2>Donald Trump</h2>

<h3>Political Orientation</h3>

<p>Donald Trump is affiliated with the Republican Party, which is a right-leaning party. His key policy proposals include bringing back the economy, protecting US manufacturing, implementing an 'America First' foreign policy, building a border wall and curbing immigration, lowering drug costs and healthcare reform, promoting US energy, and defending the Second Amendment. He has also proposed tax cuts, stricter immigration policies, increased military spending, and does not believe in climate change. He does not support cutting Social Security or Medicare benefits and supports limiting restrictions on guns. He has an extensive immigration plan that includes building a wall at the Mexican border, deporting undocumented individuals with criminal records, and temporarily banning some migrants from entering the United States. He wants to repeal and replace Obamacare, limit and ban abortion at some point in pregnancy, and significantly reduce income taxes for most Americans. He also aims to lower individual and corporate taxes, cut regulations, end trade deficits, undo Obamacare, cut drug prices, reform Medicaid, and get and keep the economy reopened. He has challenged international alliances, embraced adversaries, limited access to abortion, imposed a ban on transgender troops in the military, protected Second Amendment rights, withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, and boosted fossil fuel development.</p>

<p>Assigned label: <strong>Very Conservative</strong></p>

<h3>Economic Policy</h3>

<p>Donald Trump's proposed economic policies included individual and corporate tax cuts, attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, trade protectionism, immigration restriction, and deregulation. He also responded to the COVID-19 pandemic. His policies resulted in increased federal budget deficits and the national debt. The number of uninsured Americans increased, and his tax cuts were projected to worsen income inequality. The impact of his policies on healthcare costs and coverage was mixed. Repealing the ACA would have adverse consequences. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act primarily benefited higher-income taxpayers and increased the budget deficit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_policy_of_the_Donald_Trump_administration">source 1</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of infrastructure, Trump sought an infrastructure bill worth $2 trillion and mentioned winning the 5G race and establishing a national high-speed wireless internet network. On taxes, Trump wanted to extend the individual income tax provisions included in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and proposed tax credits for companies that bring jobs back to the U.S. On healthcare, Trump proposed spending cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and aimed to lower healthcare insurance premiums and end surprise billing. In terms of trade, Trump pursued a trade war with China and aimed to put America first in all dealings with countries. On jobs and wages, Trump aimed to create jobs through infrastructure investments and wanted to continue the "Buy American, Hire American" immigration agenda. On climate change, Trump did not believe in climate change and rolled back environmental rules. Finally, on student debt, Trump proposed eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program and replacing the four income-driven repayment programs with a single one <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/comparing-the-economic-plans-of-trump-and-biden-4843240">source 3</a>.</p>

<p>The predicted impact of Donald Trump's proposed economic policies on the economy is mixed. Some measures, such as tax cuts and deregulation, were intended to stimulate economic growth, but they also contributed to income inequality and increased the budget deficit. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was seen as a positive step, particularly in terms of reducing the corporate tax rate and allowing for immediate expensing of business investments. However, Trump's handling of fiscal policy has been criticized for increased spending and a growing deficit. His trade policies, particularly his use of tariffs, have been viewed as detrimental, resulting in higher prices for imported goods, reduced U.S. exports, and increased economic uncertainty. The COVID-19 pandemic further complicated the economic situation during Trump's presidency, with his response focusing on reopening the economy instead of controlling the virus, leading to significant damage to the economy.</p>

<p>Donald Trump's track record on economic issues is characterized by both achievements and controversies. During his presidency, he implemented policies such as tax cuts, deregulation, and a trade war with China. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 provided major tax breaks to corporations and wealthy individuals, which some experts argue increased income inequality. Trump's trade war with China resulted in tariffs and retaliatory measures, leading to increased uncertainty and a larger trade deficit. However, the stock market experienced significant gains during his presidency, although economists attribute this to expansionary policies from the Federal Reserve rather than Trump's actions.</p>

<p>Trump also focused on policies aimed at improving the financial status of the middle class and minorities. He reduced taxes, which helped stimulate economic growth. Trump also focused on domestic energy production, leading to increased energy independence. Additionally, he renegotiated trade deals to prioritize American interests. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Trump's economic policies yielded positive results. The unemployment rate reached near-historic lows, and the inflation rate remained low. The poverty rate declined, and household wealth, including stocks, savings, and real estate, reached record levels. Median income also rose significantly, particularly benefiting minorities.</p>

<p>However, Trump's economic legacy is also marred by his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a severe economic downturn and job losses. Economists argue that his lack of leadership and focus on reopening the economy instead of controlling the virus exacerbated the crisis.</p>

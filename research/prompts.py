answer_query_based_on_partial_page_system_prompt = '''
# MISSION
Answer a query using provided (partial) webpage data, including title, URL, text content, and potential context. Provide full context for the next piece of partial text to be processed correctly; assume the next call will not have access to this page but only the context, so include everything you think is relevant.

# PROCESS
1. Analyze the query and the given data.
2. If context is provided, use it to enhance your answer.
3. Summarize the answer in a detailed yet concise manner.

# GUIDELINES
- If the answer is not found in the page data, state it clearly.
- Do not fabricate information.
- Provide context for the next call if necessary (e.g., if a paragraph was cut short, include relevant header information, section, etc. for continuity). Assume the data is partial data from the page. Be very detailed in the context.
- If unable to answer but found important information, include it in the context for the next call.
- Pay attention to the details of the query and make sure the answer is suitable for the intent of the query.
- A potential answer might have been provided. This means you thought you found the answer in a previous partial text for the same page. You should double-check that and provide an alternative revised answer if you think it's wrong, or repeat it if you think it's right.

# INPUT
- Query
- Webpage title
- URL
- Partial text content of the page
- Context (if provided)
- Previous answer based on partial text that came before this for the same page

# OUTPUT
- Succinct truthful answer to the query based on the webpage data and context. 
- Context and bookmark information for the next piece of partial data. You will use it in the next call with the same page but the next partial data. It should include any important information that may assist in crafting the answer, like the last section, table information, etc. Should contain everything needed to understand a partial piece of text and answer the query for the next call. Context should not be succinct; it should be as detailed as possible.

# OUTPUT FORMAT
ANSWER: ...
CONTEXT: ...

aggregate_query_answers_system_prompt = '''
# MISSION
Aggregate and analyze a list of answers with sources to a given query, reject unlikely or minority answers, and provide a final, accurate response. If no relevant data is found, state that the answer could not be found.

# PROCESS
1. Receive the query and list of answers with sources.
2. Analyze the answers:
   - Discard answers that seem unlikely or are a minority in the list.
   - Prioritize answers with a consensus.
3. Formulate a final answer based on the remaining, most likely answers.
4. If no relevant data is found, respond with "The answer could not be found."

# INPUT
- A query
- A list of answers with sources

# OUTPUT
- The final aggregated answer to the query, with no additional information or fluff.
